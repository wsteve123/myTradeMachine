Open/Close position when:

	- Pivot triggers (low to high, high to low transitions based on moving average); No other factors.
	- Closing Price; uses "days" parameter that is defined by user. 
	  Open a position when closing price for last X days are above the moving average.
	  Close a position when closing price for last X days are below the moving average.
	- Trend Confirms. Used with Closing price above. This gives an appurtunity to re-enter the position if after X days after
	  a position is closed, the trend confirms the orignal position. The position is then re-enterred. The days associated with
	  this option represent a period of time where Closing prices are ignored. Nothing happens until the number of days 
	  expire. At that point if the trend confirms the original trend, the position is re-enterred. By trend confirm, we mean 
	  the trend must be up (for long pos), AND the closing price (of previos day) is above the moving average. This catches 
	  "fake outs" where the original trend was not actually broken. 
	   
	- OR; you can OR any of the selected items above. If more than one of the above are selected, and OR is not selected, then
	  the AND funtion is assumed.

	Open Long Position
	- Pivot. Low to high trend transition occures, triggers a buy.
	- Closing Price. If for X days (associated with Closing Price), the closing price is above the moving average, trigger a Buy.
	- Trend Confirms. Only used when a position is Closed based on Closing Price. Allow cool off period of X days before 
	  evaluating the trend again to determine if the positin should be 
	  re-enterred; After X days (cool off, nothing is evaluated), look at both previous days closing price AND the trend, to 
	  determine if the posiiton is re-enterred. If confirmed, re-enter, othewise leave position closed.

	Close Long Position
	- Pivot. High to low trend transition occures, triggers a SELL.
	- Closing Price. If for X days (associated with Closing Price), the closing price is below the moving average, trigger 
	  a SELL. 
	- Trend Confirms. Only used when a poition is Closed based on Closing Price. Allow cool off period of X days before 
	  evaluating the trend again to determine if the positin should be 
	  re-enterred; After X days (cool off, nothing is evaluated), evaluate both the previous days closing 
	  price AND the trend, to determine if the posiiton is re-enterred. 
	  If trend confirmed, re-enter, othewise leave position closed.
 
	Open Short Position
	- Pivot. High to Low trend transition occures, trigger a sell (sell to open).
	- Closing Price. If for X days (associated iwth Closing Price), the closing price is below the moving average, 
	  trigger a Sell (sell to open).
	- Trend Confirms. Only used when a position is Closed based on Closing Price. Allow cool off period of X days 
	  before evaluating the trend again to determine if the positin should be 
	  re-enterred; After X days (cool off, nothing is evaluated), evaluate both the previous days closing 
	  price AND the trend, to determine if the posiiton is re-enterred. 
	  If trend confirmed, re-enter, othewise leave position closed. For short position, Trend must be down, and 
 	  previous day's closing price, is below the moving average. If this is true, the position is re-enterred. Otherwise not.

	Close Short Position
	- Pivot. Low to High trend transition occures, triggers a buy (buy to close).
	- Closing Price. If for X days (associated with Closing Price), the closing price is above the moving average, trigger
	  a Buy (buy to close).
	- Trend Confirms. Only used when a position is Closed based on Closing price. Allow cool off period of X days 
	  before evaluating the trend again to determine if the position should be 
	  re-enterred; After X days (cool off, nothing is evaluated), evaluate both the previous days closing 
	  price AND the trend, to determine if the posiiton is re-enterred. 
	  If trend confirmed, re-enter, othewise leave position closed. For short position, Trend must be down, and 
 	  previous day's closing price, is below the moving average. If this is true, the position is re-enterred. Otherwise not.


	Parameters

	Pivot; no other parameters.

	Closing Price. One parameter Field "Closing Days", enabled when this option is selected. Default is zero, user
	enters an integer >= 0. Zero disables this option. If the Close Price is not selected, disable the field.

	Trend Confirms. One parameter Field for "Hysterysis in Days", enabled when trend confirms option is selected. 
	Default is zero, user enters an integer >= 0. Zero disables this option. If Trend Confirms is not selected, disable
	the Hysterysis Days field.

	notes:
	go back X days in history, starting with yesterday minus X days (closing days). Look for consecutive days. 
	For example: 
	  Open Pivot only works as it does today.
	  if openClosingDays is set and days is set to 5. This means 5 consecutive days starting with yesterday must have 
	  closing values greater than the moving average. Count days above MA back X days. The result must equal the 
	  xdays. If it does the condition is met. If the count is less than X days, the condition failed.
	  if both Pivot AND openClosingDays is selected, both a Pivot must have occurred AND ClosingDays count must pass 
 	  before triggering a buy.

	  Close Pivot works as it does today. 

	  if closeClosingDays is set and closingDays is set to 2. This means 2 consecutev days starting with 
	  yesterday must have closing values below MA. Count days below MA back X days. The result must equal Xdays. 
 	  If equal, the condition is met, and the position is closed.  
 
	  If Re-open in XDays is set and XDays is set to 3 days. This means, that after a position is closed because of 
	  closeDays happenned, the position is in idle (no trade state), for 3 full days. During these days, the position  
	  is ignored, skipped. On the fourth day, if the postion is trading greater than the MA AND the trend confirms UP, 
	  re-enter the position, trigger a buy. At this point, the process starts again. 
	  
	  For openClosingDays, Need to count back in time number of days closing values were either above or below that days MA. 
	  Same for ClosingDays; both above and below MA, depending if Long or Short. The count must equal the Days value. 
	  
	  For Re-open in XDays, each position needs remember that a postioin was closed because of ClosingDays. And 
	  count (re-openDays) days, where nothing is done. We can call this Hysterysis, a boolean, that when first set true, a 
	  Hysterysis Day count is set to Re-openDays value. Every new day, going forward, this HysterysisDay Count is 
	  decremented by one. If the value is then zero, time has elapsed, and the very next day, we look to see if yesterdays 
	  closing value is either above or below the MA (depends on longShort) AND that the trend confirms (Up/Dn), depending 
	  on long or short. If true and trend confirms, the position is re-opened. 
	  So this means, a counter called hysterysisCnt is added to each position and stored to file. This Cnt is set to re-openDays 
	  initially, and as long as it is not zero when decremented, the position is ignored, no trades can be done. This count can 
	  only be decremented once a day, so current newDay must be used. Once it transitions from 1 to 0, the yesterdays closing
	  value is compared with the MA value. If it confirms the trend AND the actual trend confirms, the position is re-opened.

	  BackTesting
	  	go back in time one year in time. record every pivot, close count, and trend for every day until today:

		pivot: trendChanged(boolean), new trend(string: TrendUp or TrendDn).
	 	close count: count back x days (in config), count how many times closing prices were above 10ma, and how many closing
		prices were below the 10ma. closeAboveCnt(integer), closeBelowCnt(integer).
		trend. TrendUp or TrendDn (string).
